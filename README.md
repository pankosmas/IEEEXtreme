IEEEXtreme

IEEEXtreme is a global competition organised every year by IEEE. Its duration is 24 hours and teams from all over the world try to solve algorithmic problems that come out every 30 minutes.

Personally, it was my first year participating as a student in this contest and I focused especially in two significant problems. My suggested solutions are not the optimal, since they were both accepted as correct (given the right outputs) but they didnt meet the best time constraints parameters. 
As a result they both performed 50% of the total points, but it was a nice approach to the problem.
